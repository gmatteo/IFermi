# Summary

The Fermi surface is an important tool for understanding the electronic, optical, and
magnetic properties of metals and doped semiconductors [@review].
It defines the surface in reciprocal space that divides unoccupied and occupied
states at zero temperature.
The topology of the Fermi surface impacts a variety of quantum phenomena including
superconductivity, topological insulation, and ferromagnetism, and it can be used to
predict the complex behaviour of systems without requiring more detailed computations.
For example: (i) large nested Fermi sheets are a characteristic of charge density ordering [@cdw];
(ii) the size and position of Fermi pockets are indicators of high-performance
thermoelectrics [@thermoelectrics]; and (iii) the average group velocities across the
Fermi surface control the sensitivity of materials for dark matter detection [@darkmatter].
IFermi is a Python library for the generation, analysis, and visualisation of Fermi
surfaces that can facilitate sophisticated analyses of Fermi 
surface properties.

# Statement of need

Many tools already exist for the generation of Fermi surfaces from *ab initio* band 
structure calculations. For example, several electronic structure codes such as 
CASTEP [@castep] and QuantumATK [@quantumatk] include integrated tools for obtaining Fermi 
surfaces. Furthermore, 
software such as FermiSurfer [@fermisurfer], pyprocar [@pyprocar], BoltzTraP2 [@boltztrap2], 
and XCrysDen [@xcrysden] interface with common 
density functional theory packages and can plot Fermi surfaces from their 
outputs. All such packages, however, are only designed to visualise Fermi surfaces
and do not expose any application programming interfaces (APIs) for analysing and 
manipulating Fermi surfaces as objects. In IFermi, we address these limitations by developing
a fully-featured Python library for representing and processing Fermi surfaces
and Fermi slices. We also implement a novel algorithm for determining the dimensionality
of Fermi surfaces using the connectivity across periodic boundaries and the
Euler characteristic of the isosurface mesh. IFermi, therefore, enables the 
programmatic characterisation of Fermi surfaces and can be used as a foundational 
library for investigating complex Fermi surface properties such as nesting.

# IFermi

IFermi is a Python 3.6+ library and set of command-line tools for the generation, 
analysis, and visualisation of Fermi surfaces and Fermi slices. The goal of the library 
is to provide fully-featured `FermiSurface` and `FermiSlice` objects that allow for easy 
manipulation and programmatic analysis. The main features of the package include: 

- The Fourier interpolation of electronic band structures onto dense k-point meshes 
  required to obtain high resolution Fermi surfaces.
- The extraction of Fermi surfaces and Fermi slices from electronic band structures.
- A rich API for representing and manipulating Fermi surface objects.
- The projection of arbitrary properties onto Fermi surfaces and Fermi slices.
- Algorithms to calculate Fermi surface properties, including dimensionality, orientation, 
  and averaged projections such as Fermi velocities.
- Interactive visualisation of Fermi surfaces and slices, and their projections such as 
  spin-texture, with support for mayavi [@mayavi], plotly [@plotly] and matplotlib [@matplotlib]. 
  Examples of the graphics produced by IFermi are presented in Figure 1.

In addition to the Python library, IFermi includes several command-line tools that can
perform common tasks such as calculating Fermi surface dimensionality and Fermi velocities.
IFermi uses the pymatgen [@pymatgen] library for parsing first-principles calculation 
outputs and therefore supports all electronic structure codes supported therein. 
At the time of writing this 
comprises Vienna *ab initio* Simulation Package (VASP), ABINIT, and CP2K. IFermi also 
relies on  several open source packages, such as BoltzTraP2 [@boltztrap2] for Fourier 
interpolation, trimesh [@trimesh] for processing triangular meshes, and scikit-image 
[@scikitimage] for generating isosurfaces using the marching cubes algorithm developed 
by @marchingcubes.
